# TorchExpo
Collection of Machine Learning Experiments using PyTorch Android API

## What is TorchExpo?
TorchExpo is an android application which contains collection of machine learning experiments
built using PyTorch and its Android API. This application will allow you to try tasks like Image
Classification with State-Of-The-Art models _(like AlexNet, ResNet, etc.)_.

### Built With
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [PyTorch Android API](https://pytorch.org/mobile/android/)
* [Android Ecosystem](https://developer.android.com)

### PyTorch Android API
PyTorch Mobile provides Java APIs for integration of Machine Learning models built with Python
into an Android application. It is as simple as importing and using any other Android library. You
can add PyTorch's Gradle dependencies and can run inferences.
